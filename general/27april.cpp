// For an railway reservation system to reserve the tickets various classes are defined. In that passenger is a class which will consider passenger details like name, age, mobile number, breadth preference and others based on the requirements of details and the class will display those details before the payment. To reserve the tickets to the passenger, the class uses one input function to get the details of the passenger. The class will check the senior citizen of the passenger based on the age.
